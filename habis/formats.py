	Read the capture of a single HABIS fire sequence (with any number of

	from zero.

	The data is sorted first by channel and then by repetition index before
	processing.

	The return value is a tuple (output, channels, repetitions), where
	output is 3-D array of the form output[i,j,k], where i is the receive
	channel index, j is the repetition, and k is the sample index. Every
	receive channel must contain the same number of repetitions or a
	ValueError will be raised. The list channels contains elements that
	indicate the channel indices identified in the file, such that
	channels[i] is the listed channel index for slice output[i,:,:].
	The list repetitions is similarly defined such that reptitions[j] is
	the listed repetition index for slice output[:,j,:].

	If reducer is not None, it should be a callable that takes as input the
	raw array data read from f and returns a filtered version of the data
	that will be processed as that were the raw data read from the file.

	sequence, and concatenated along a new first axis.

	The channel and reptition indices returned by readfirecapture() are
	ignored. However, because np.concatenate() is used to produce the
	concatenated output, every readfirecapture() array must have the same
	shape.
